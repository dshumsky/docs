#### Computer system

Here's an example computer architecture in very high level:

![system_00](img/system_00.png)
![system_01](img/system_01.png)

- `CPU` is a central processing unit, *or processor*, that interprets and 
	executes the machine instructions stored in `main memory`. Processor has a small storage called `register` to provide the fastest way to access data.
- `Main memory` is a temporary storage both for executing programs and 
	data during execution.
- `Disk` stores data. It can contain more data than memory, but is much
	slower to read from disks.

#### Memory hierarchy

![memory_hierarchy](img/memory_hierarchy.png)

- Computer's total system memory is from `RAM` (physical memory)
	and `virtual memory`.
- `Main memory` or **Random-access memory** (`RAM`) is a form of computer
	data storage that can be accessed randomly when you know the
	intersecting row and column at cell. It consists of collection of `DRAM`.
- [`DRAM` (Dynamic Random Access Memory)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_random-access_memory) is used for `main memory`. Data get lost when the power is off.
- [`SRAM` (Static Random Access Memory)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_random-access_memory) is faster and less volatile than `DRAM`
	but more expensive. It's typically used for **`CPU` cache**.

#### Why virtual memory?

For a program to run, code and its data must be accessible in main memory, but
the memory might not be large enough to handle the entire process. Having a
very large memory to fit them all is very costly. This is where `virtual
memory` comes in. It separates *logical memory required by process* from
*physical memory of processor*. And it provides each program with its own
complete and independent memory.

`Virtual memory` is an abstraction layer of `main memory` for `process`.
Each process can have an uniform way of looking at the memory, which is
known as `virtual address space`. Each process can have its own `virtual
address space` for memory management, and its memory addresses. `Virtual
memory` with `virtual address space` is useful for multiple programs running
at the same time with shared resources, because each data object can get
multiple **independent** addresses. `Virtual memory` keeps memory isolated
from other processes and prevents data corruption from each other. And size
of `virtual memory` is limited by the size of pointers on a given operating
system.

Another great answer [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/19349645/4211028):

#### Page cache
